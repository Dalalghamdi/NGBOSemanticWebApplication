# Next Generation Biobanking Semantic Web Application

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository provides an open-source **semantic web application** for **federated querying and integration of omics-derived biobank data** across distributed repositories.

Developed as part of the doctoral thesis:

> *Introduction of Omics Metadata into Biobanking Ontology*

## ‚ú® Overview

Traditional biobank data systems are siloed, making it difficult for researchers to **find, access, and integrate specimen-related data** scattered across institutions. Centralized data warehouses can be costly, slow to update, and may conflict with data governance policies.

This application offers a **federated querying approach** using Semantic Web technologies, enabling:

- Real-time queries over multiple biobank SPARQL endpoints
- No need to centralize or duplicate data
- Support for **FAIR Data Principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
- Fine-grained, ontology-driven access control
- User-friendly web interface for researchers and data managers
